## Core Basics: Databases, Collections and Documents:

<hr />

>   ### In MongoDB, we have one or more databases on the database server


>   ### Each database can hold one or more collections
                        
A collection would be a table in a SQL database


>   ### In that collection we have documents/data-pieces that we are storing in the db



<hr />


<h3>Important to note that working with MongoDB, the databases, the collectinons and the documents are all automatically created for us implicitly --> as soon as we start working with them / storing data </h3>


>   It s also possible to create new collections explicitly, which allows us to configure them a bit further


<hr />


### MongoDB offers drivers for all server side languages, follow <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/tutorial">documentation</a> based on used language
